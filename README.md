# Grokking FP examples

This project contains all the source code included in the ["Grokking Functional Programming"](https://michalplachta.com/book) book. It's best to use it as an additional reference and to explore some ideas. After each chapter, we remind you that the source code is up for you to explore. Note that some chapters have more than one file, in both `java` and `scala` subdirectories. Each file is prefixed with the chapter number.

You can also use this project to follow along all the snippets in the book marked with `>`. To do this, just execute `sbt console` in the root directory and you are set! 

If you get familiar with how the book and its exercises work, you free to import `build.sbt` file to your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA) and do the exercises and exploration there.

Enjoy and good luck!
